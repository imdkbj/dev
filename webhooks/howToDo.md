# Setup Webhook for masterBOT.

You need to manually set the webhook for this bot.

Format = https://api.telegram.org/bot< TOKEN >/setwebhook?url=< SERVER >?masterbot=bot< TOKEN >

TOKEN = 12345:DBFLKDJBFLJKFLKS

SERVER = https://xyz.com:8443

This will look like following...

https://api.telegram.org/bot12345:DBFLKDJBFLJKFLKS/setwebhook?url=https://xyz.com:8443?masterbot=bot12345:DBFLKDJBFLJKFLKS

Once you make the url, Just copy paste this in browesr and hit enter.

# Now run the runme.js

Go to maser bot and it will ask you to send token for any additional public bots u want to setup.

All rest bots will follow the same code logic which is inside the bot.js file.
